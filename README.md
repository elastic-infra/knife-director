## Provided commands

### knife director bootstrap XXX

`XXX` can be `linux` or `windows`.

It wraps `knife bootstrap` or `knife bootstrap windows winrm`.
You can't omit `-E (--environment)` option.

You need not specify `-N (--node-name)` option since it sets FQDN as the node name,
but you can do it to explicitly specify.

It automatically passes `--bootstrap-template` option to them.
Prepare `.chef/bootstrap/{linux,windows}.erb` or pass `-t __no_template__` to disable template.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
